Elements are:
* Building blocks
* The smallest "studyable" unit
* A framework/checklist for building a game

## Activity 1

Brainstorm list of elements as a group.

Take the list and test it - present across a variety of games?

Which of our elements are really elements?

Can you turn some of the "non-elements" into elements (make them more general?) or find them homes in the other elements?

## Activity 2

* Dig into Doug Church & Ian Schreiber
* Other writers - areas of agreement and new elements
* Patterns
  - Examples

## Product
